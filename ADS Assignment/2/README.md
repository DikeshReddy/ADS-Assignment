# Question 2

**2.Zachary's karate club network, accessible as karate.gml via NetworkX, analyzes group conflicts and fission. It comprises 34 nodes representing club members and edges indicating interactions outside club activities.**

This Python script analyzes Zachary's karate club network from the "karate.gml" file using NetworkX, a graph analysis library. It performs the following tasks:

i. Creates a graph from the "karate.gml" file and displays basic information about the network.

ii. Stores metadata of actors in the network.

iii. Calculates various centrality measures (degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, and pagerank centrality) and provides an analysis based on the centrality values.

iv. Finds possible k-components of the network and computes the clustering coefficient.

v. Identifies communities using the Girvan-Newman algorithm and Louvain method.
